A demonstration of a "super privileged container" that allows you to bind mount into a running ordinary container from a privileged container. 

Look at `doBindMount` in `volume.py`

`run.sh` shows the launch requirements for this to be "super privileged".

Highly experimental. Don't actually use it in this form!
